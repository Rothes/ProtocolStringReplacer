      Replacement: '{"text":"Congratulations for opening a furnace! Nice job!"}'
  # Direct replace mode. Suitable for users who are not familiar with Json replacement.
  # By default, If any content is replaced here, Json and Common replace modes
  # will no longer take effect for this packet. You can disable it in Config.yml.
  # In addition to Json, this also supports 1.16+ HEX.
  # Note: If direct replace mod replaced the string, it will break non-text component display in Json.
  # ^ This means that after the replacement the message will cause the side effects that the message being
  # ^ not clickable, remove mouseover display and translation effects, etc. (if it originally has)
